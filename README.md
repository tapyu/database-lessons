# Databases

**[A database][datacamp1] is a storage system to house your structured data**. It can be a:

- File-based database: It is a single file on your local machine, with the extension name `.db`, `.sqlite`, etc. You can open this file with database viewer to see its structure.
- Directory-based database: Other database systems use directories to store their data. Inside these directories, you will find multiple files that make up the database.
- Server-Based database: Some databases are managed by a database server, and the actual data files may be stored in a location defined by the server.

### Relational database structure

[A relational database][aws] stores information in tabular form, with rows and columns representing different data attributes and the various **relationships between the data values**.
