## NoSQL

[NoSQL][aws] refers to non-relational databases that don't use tables to store data. Developers store information in different types of NoSQL databases, including graphs, documents, and key-values. NoSQL databases are popular for modern applications because they are horizontally scalable. Horizontal scaling means increasing the processing power by adding more computers that run NoSQL software.
