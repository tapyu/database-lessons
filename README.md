**[SQL][aws] is a programming language** for storing and processing information in a relational database. [It][datacamp] is designed for managing data stored in a RDBMS using **SQL queries**. A query is nothing but a statement consisting of various SQL commands that together perform a specific task to access, manage, modify, update, control, and organize your data.

SQL was invented in the 1970s based on the relational data model. It was initially known as the structured English query language (SEQUEL). The term was later shortened to SQL. Oracle, formerly known as Relational Software, became the first vendor to offer a commercial SQL relational database management system.

With SQL, you can query, or ask questions of, the data in a relational database. You can use SQL statements to store, update, remove, search, and retrieve information from the database. You can also use SQL to maintain and optimize database performance.

SQL queries and other operations take the form of commands written as statements and are aggregated into programs that enable users to add, modify or retrieve data from database tables.
